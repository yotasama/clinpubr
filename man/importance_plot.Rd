\arguments{
\item{x}{A named vector of values, typically importance scores from models.}

\item{top_n}{The number of top values to show. If NULL, all values are shown.}

\item{color}{A length-2 vector of low and high colors, or a single color for the bars.}

\item{show_legend}{A logical value indicating whether to show the legend.}

\item{split_at}{The index at which to split the plot into two halves, usually used to illustrate
variable selection. If NULL, no split is made.}

\item{show_labels}{A logical value indicating whether to show the labels on the bars.}

\item{label_nsmall}{The number of decimal places to show in the labels.}

\item{label_color}{The color of the labels.}

\item{label_size}{The size of the labels.}

\item{label_hjust}{The horizontal justification of the labels.}

\item{save_plot}{A logical value indicating whether to save the plot.}

\item{filename}{The filename to save the plot as.}

\value{
A \code{ggplot} object

\description{
Creates an importance plot from a named vector of values.
}
\details{
The importance plot is a bar plot that shows the importance of each variable in a model.
The variables are sorted in descending order of importance, and the top_n variables are shown.
If top_n is NULL, all variables are shown. The plot can be split into two halves at a specified
index, which is useful for illustrating variable selection.

set.seed(1)
dummy_importance <- runif(20)^5
names(dummy_importance) <- paste0("var", 1:20)
importance_plot(dummy_importance, top_n = 15, split_at = 10)
