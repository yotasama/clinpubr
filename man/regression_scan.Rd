\title{Scan for significant regression predictors}
\usage{
regression_scan(
  data,
  y,
  time = NULL,
  predictors = NULL,
  covs = NULL,
  try_rcs = TRUE,
  save_table = TRUE,
  filename = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{y}{A character string of the outcome variable.}

\item{time}{A character string of the time variable. If \code{NULL}, logistic regression is used.
Otherwise, Cox proportional hazards regression is used.}

\item{predictors}{The predictor variables to be scanned for interactions. If \code{NULL}, all variables
except \code{y} and \code{time} are taken as predictors.}

\item{covs}{A character vector of covariate names.}

\item{save_table}{A logical value indicating whether to save the results as a table.}

\item{filename}{The name of the file to save the results. File will be saved in \code{.csv} format.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the results of the interaction analysis.
}
\description{
Scan for significant regression predictors and output results. Both logistic and Cox
proportional hazards regression models are supported. The predictor variables in the model are can be
used both in linear form or in ristricted cubic spline form.

\examples{
data(cancer, package = "survival")
int_scan(cancer, y = "status", time = "time")
}
