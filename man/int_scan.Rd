\title{Scan interactions between variables}
\usage{
int_scan(
  data,
  y,
  time = NULL,
  predictors = NULL,
  group_vars = NULL,
  try_rcs = TRUE,
  save_table = TRUE,
  filename = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{y}{A character string of the outcome variable.}

\item{time}{A character string of the time variable. If \code{NULL}, logistic regression is used.
Otherwise, Cox proportional hazards regression is used.}

\item{predictors}{The predictor variables to be scanned for interactions. If \code{NULL}, all variables
except \code{y} and \code{time} are taken as predictors.}

\item{group_vars}{The group variables to be scanned for interactions. If \code{NULL}, all variables
except \code{y} and \code{time} are taken as group variables. The group variables should be categorical. If a
numeric variable is included, it will be splited by the median value.}

\item{try_rcs}{A logical value indicating whether to perform ristricted cubic spline interaction analysis.}

\item{save_table}{A logical value indicating whether to save the results as a table.}

\item{filename}{The name of the file to save the results. Support both \code{.xlsx} and \code{.csv} formats.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the results of the interaction analysis.
}
\description{
Scan interactions between variables and output results as tables. Both logistic and Cox
proportional hazards regression models are supported. The predictor variables in the model are can be
used both in linear form or in ristricted cubic spline form.
}
\examples{
data(cancer, package = "survival")
int_scan(cancer, y = "status", time = "time")
}
