\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{x}{A character string of the predictor variable.}

\item{y}{A character string of the outcome variable.}

\item{time}{A character string of the time variable. If \code{NULL}, logistic regression is used.
Otherwise, Cox proportional hazards regression is used.}

\item{model_covs}{A character vector or a named list of covariates for different models.
If \code{NULL}, only the crude model is used.}

\item{ratio_nsmall}{The minimum number of digits to the right of the decimal point for the OR or HR.}

\item{pval_nsmall}{The minimum number of digits to the right of the decimal point for the p-value.}

\item{pval_eps}{The threshold for rounding p values to 0.}

\item{xlab}{A character string of the x-axis label.}

\item{height}{The height of the plot.}

\item{width}{The width of the plot.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the \code{survminer::ggsurvplot} function for KM curve.}

\item{pers}{A numeric vector of the denominators of variable \code{x}. Set this denominator to obtain a reasonable
OR or HR.}

\item{factor_breaks}{A numeric vector of the breaks to factorize the \code{x} variable.}

\item{factor_labels}{A character vector of the labels for the factor levels.}

\item{quantile_breaks}{A numeric vector of the quantile breaks to factorize the \code{x} variable.}

\item{quantile_labels}{A character vector of the labels for the quantile levels.}

\item{label_with_range}{A logical value indicating whether to add the range of the levels to the labels.}

\item{output_dir}{A character string of the directory to save the output files.}

\item{ref_levels}{A vector of strings of the reference levels of the factor variable. You can use \code{"lowest"}
or \code{"highest"} to select the lowest or highest level as the reference level. Otherwise, any level that
matches the provided strings will be used as the reference level.}

\item{median_nsmall}{The minimum number of digits to the right of the decimal point for the median survival time.}

\item{colors}{A vector of colors for the KM curves.}

\item{legend_title}{A character string of the title of the legend.}

\item{legend_pos}{A numeric vector of the position of the legend.}

\item{pval_pos}{A numeric vector of the position of the p-value.}

\description{
Generate the result table of logistic or Cox regression with different settings of the predictor
variable and covariates. Also generate KM curves for Cox regression.

Generate the forest plot of logistic or Cox regression with different models.
}
\details{
The function \code{regression_basic_results} generates the result table of logistic or Cox regression with
different settings of the predictor variable and covariates. The setting of the predictor variable includes
the original \code{x}, the standardized \code{x}, the log of \code{x}, and \code{x} divided by denominators in \code{pers} as continuous
variables, and the factorization of the variable including split by median, by quartiles, and by \code{factor_breaks}
and \code{quantile_breaks}. The setting of the covariates includes different models with different covariates.

For factor variables with more than 2 levels, p value for trend is also calculated.
