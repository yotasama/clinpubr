\title{Performance comparison of classification models}
\usage{
classif_model_compare(pred_list, target, filename = "model_compare.csv")
}
\arguments{
\item{pred_list}{A named list of predictions from models.}

\item{target}{A favtor vector of classification labels with two levels. The second
level would be considered positive. Must be of the same length as the prediction
sublists form \code{pred_list}.}

\item{filename}{A string specifying the filename to save the comparison results.}
}
\value{
A data frame with additional columns.
}
\description{
Compare the performance of classification models by commonly used
metrics.
}
\details{
This function calculates various performance metrics for each model
in the \code{pred_list} and saves the results to a CSV file.
}
\section{Metrics}{

\itemize{
\item AUC: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve
\item Accuracy: Overall accuracy
\item Sensitivity: True positive rate
\item Specificity: True negative rate
\item Pos Pred Value: Positive predictive value
\item Neg Pred Value: Negative predictive value
\item F1: F1 score
\item Kappa: Cohen's kappa
\item Brier: Brier score
\item cutoff: Optimal cutoff for classification, metrics that require a cutoff are
based on this value.
\item Youden: Youden's J statistic
\item HosLem: Hosmer-Lemeshow test p-value
}
